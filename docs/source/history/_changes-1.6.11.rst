This is the last release of the 1.6 series.  It's being synchronized with
release 1.7.0 to deprecate here what's being changed there.

- The `defaults` argument of ``xoutil.objects.smart_copy`` is marked to be
  keyword-only in version 1.7.0.

- Fixes a bug in ``xoutil.objects.smart_copy``.  If `defaults` was None is
  was not being treated the same as being False, as documented.  This bug was
  also fixed in version 1.7.0.

- ``xoutil.objects.metaclass`` will be moved to ``xoutil.eight.meta`` in
  version 1.7.0 and deprecated, it will be removed from ``xoutil.object`` in
  version 1.7.1.


- This release will be the last to support Python 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Support
  will be kept for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
