"""Helpers for bounded execution of co-routines.

Example::

    >>> def fibonacci():
    ...   a, b = 1, 1
    ...   while True:
    ...       yield a
    ...       a, b = b, a + b

This function yields forever.  This module allows to get instances of that
function that run until a boundary condition is met.  For instance, the
`times`:func: boundary stops after a given numbers of results are generated::

    >>> fib8 = times(8)(fibonacci)
    >>> fib8()   # the 8th fibonacci number is
    21

This is repeatable::

    >>> fib8()   # the 8th fibonacci number is
    21

    >>> fib8()   # the 8th fibonacci number is
    21

Unless you pass in a generator::

    >>> fib8 = times(8)(fibonacci())
    >>> fib8()
    21

    >>> fib8() is None
    True

    The `definition` must be a function that returns a generator.  The
    following rules **must be** followed.  Collectively these rules are called
    the `boundary protocol`.

    - The `boundary definition` will yield True when and only when the
      boundary condition is met.  Only the value True will signal the boundary
      condition.

    - The `boundary definition` must yield at least 2 times:

      - First it will be called its ``next()`` method to allow for
        initialization of internal state.

      - Immediately after, it will be called its ``send()`` passing the tuple
        ``(args, kwargs)`` with the arguments passed to the `unbounded
        function`.  At this point the boundary definition may yield True to
        halt the execution.  In this case, the `unbounded generator` won't be
        asked for any value.

    - The `boundary definition` must yield True before terminating with a
      StopIteration.  For instance the following definition is invalid cause
      it ends without yielding True::

          @boundary
          def invalid():
              yield
              yield False

    - The `boundary definition` must deal with GeneratorExit exceptions
      properly since we call the ``close()`` method of the generator upon
      termination.  Termination occurs when the `unbounded generator` stops by
      any means, even when the boundary condition yielded True or the
      generator itself is exhausted or there's an error in the generator.

      Both `whenall`:func: and `whenany`:func: call the ``close()`` method of
      all their subordinate boundary conditions.

      Most of the time this reduces to *not* catching GeneratorExit
      exceptions.

    A RuntimeError may happen if any of these rules is not followed by the
    `definition`.  Furthermore, this error will occur when invoking the
    `bounded function` and not when applying the boundary to the `unbounded
    generator`.
