"""Functional Programming *Option Type* definition.

In Programming, and Type Theory, an *option type*, or *maybe type*, represents
encapsulation of an optional value; e.g., it is used in functions which may or
may not return a meaningful value when they are applied.

It consists of either a constructor encapsulating the original value ``x``
(written ``Just x`` or ``Some x``) or an empty constructor (called *None* or
*Nothing*).  Outside of functional programming, these are known as *nullable
types*.

In our case *option type* will be the `Maybe`:class: class (the equivalent of
`Option` in *Scala Programming Language*), the wrapper for valid values will
be the `Just`:class: class (equivalent of `Some` in *Scala*); and the wrapper
for invalid values will be the `Wrong`:class: class.

Instead of *None* or *Nothing*, `Wrong` is used because two reasons:
(1) already existence of `None` special Python value, and (2) `Wrong`:class:
also wraps incorrect values and can have several instances (not only a *null*
value).

"""


class Maybe:
    """Wrapper for optional values.

    The Maybe type encapsulates an optional value.  A value of type
    ``Maybe a`` either contains a value of type ``a`` (represented as
    ``Just a``), or it is empty (represented as ``Nothing``).  Using `Maybe``
    is a good way to deal with errors or exceptional cases without resorting
    to drastic measures such as error. In this implementation we make a
    variation where a ``Wrong`` object represents a missing (with special
    value ``Nothing``) or an improper value (including errors).

    See descendant classes `Just`:class: and `Wrong`:class: for more
    information.

    This implementation combines ``Maybe`` and ``Either`` Haskell data types.
    ``Maybe`` is a means of being explicit that you are not sure that a
    function will be successful when it is executed.  Conventionally, the
    usage of ``Either`` for errors uses ``Right`` when the computation is
    successful, and ``Left`` for failing scenarios.

    In this implementation, `Just`:class` us used for equivalence with both
    Haskell ``Just`` and ``Right`` types; `Wrong`:class: is used with the
    special value ``Nothing`` and to encapsulate errors or incorrect values
    (Haskell ``Left``).

    Haskell::

      data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

      either :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c

    Case analysis for the Either type.  If the value is Left a, apply the
    first function to a; if it is Right b, apply the second function to b.
