"""Facilities to work with `concrete numbers`_.

The name `dim`:mod: is a short of dimension.  We borrow it from the topic
"dimensional analysis", even though the scope of this module is less
ambitious.

This module is divided in two major parts:

- `xotl.tools.dim.meta`:mod: which allows to define almost any kind of
  quantity decorated with a unit.

- Other modules ``xotl.tools.dim.*`` which contains applications of the
  definitions in `~xotl.tools.dim.meta`:mod:.  In particular,
  `xotl.tools.dim.base`:mod: contains the `base quantities`_ for the
  `International System of Quantities`_.
